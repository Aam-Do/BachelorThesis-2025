# Designing a Digital Companion Progressive Web App Incorporating Augmented Reality for the Tabletop Roleplaying-Game World of Discordia for Educational Application in Schools
Thesis for the award of the degree Bachelor of Arts in the degree program Media Design Bachelor at the Faculty of Digital Media at Hochschule Furtwangen University.

This repository contains the thesis and appendices documenting the design and concept for a digital companion app for the World of Discordia tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG), intended for educational use in schools. The app aims to enhance the TTRPG experience for student players and Game Directors (GDs) by simplifying gameplay and providing supportive tools, including augmented reality (AR) integration. This project was developed in cooperation with Dragon Legion.

## Project Overview

The thesis investigates the potential of a progressive web app (PWA) to enhance the developmental benefits within an educational context. It explores how a digital companion app can simplify the game process without restricting the educational and social advantages of TTRPGs. Key features and considerations include:

- **User-centered design:** Focus on the specific needs of student players and GDs.
- **Augmented reality (AR):** Integration to support offline TTRPG gameplay.
- **Educational application:** Designed for implementation in school environments, considering regulatory frameworks.
- **Accessibility and Usability**: Ensuring the app is easy to use, visually appealing, and helpful for the target audience.
