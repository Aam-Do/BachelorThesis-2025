Speaker 1  (00:00)
So this is the first testing group. And for the first part of this, I would like you to just kind of like, take a look at the things that you can do. Try to stay on like the top-level of hierarchy so don't try to go too far into things, but I will also tell you when you should get back out and you can... It's a bit awkward in the group of 3, but uhm just say out loud 

Speaker 1  (00:29)
What you're thinking and you can talk to each other, what what you want to do? 

Speaker 2  (00:33)
Why are there? What are they all hero number one? 

Speaker 1  (00:37)
Because it's just the prototype and I haven't just, I haven't gotten to it. It's, it's very prototypical. So just an example of what it could be like, but I think if you tap, yeah, it should highlight the things that you can tap. So if if this was an app that you're using right now, this is not a test, again, just kind of like, say what you want to do or just do it as if it was your phone. 

Speaker 3  (01:01)
I would really like to check like, therei it says quick info, heritage, paths etc, I would reallyl like to like can you click on one. 

Speaker 1  (01:08)
Yes, you can, you may. 

Speaker 3  (01:09)
Okay, so that's just a quick on the first oh okay, I kind of assumed there was gonna be like a character sheet like just on the phone okay, so it's just.. Ah okay. It's it's already a filled out character and it already has like everything. that seems like a very cool thing. 

Speaker 1  (01:39)
I would like you to go back now because we will look at this in more detail later 

Speaker 3  (01:45)
And so there's the oh no, you probably 

Speaker 1  (01:49)
That's okay, that's like for now, just like experiment, you've you've seen this, try the way you can get do it and just just get a feel for it, just click. 

Speaker 3  (01:57)
I want to find out what the other ones down here are so just click in the next one, so Ah, okay, so it's the heroes, the games that that makes sense. Then tools, okay, yeah, that... 

Speaker 1  (02:21)
Do you do you have any idea what this could be for what you could find on this tool page? 

Speaker 3  (02:30)
Maybe something like in the direction of.. hero builder says there. So maybe something like I tools to build a character or the world or something like that, like tool to like guide through some kind of game or something like to help in general, like, if you have questions on like, I don't know how to make this and that on the character sheet that you can look through that. 

Speaker 3  (02:52)
Maybe. 

Speaker 4  (02:52)
It also be like ideas to just like, um, uh, if you're stuck in a situation, you don't know what to do like just, it's some kind of inspiration. 

Speaker 3  (03:03)
Yeah, that's so yeah, that sounds cool as well. 

Speaker 1  (03:06)
Okay, let's move on. 

Speaker 3  (03:11)
Resources that seemed like some kind of like the outline reminds me of these like story games we used to have when we were younger, like we would scroll through what kind of romance story or something like that, and we could either read them or play them. It would be like a thing of like just telling the stary, and I think maybe this would be something else like you can scroll here, probably sometimes like it looks like it. 

Speaker 3  (03:38)
And so I guess it's just like stories, it can be play or paths of Stories or short Stories or something? Like from that's what makes sense to me like from the outline. 

Speaker 1  (03:49)
Thank you. 

Speaker 3  (03:52)
A library 

Speaker 4  (03:55)
Oh I think like this might be like lexicon of like everything that exists in the world. 

Speaker 3  (04:03)
Like it says creatures they're e.g. creature so, probably something like that. That would make a lot of sense, okay, that'd be really cool as well. Like, just like a long list of what kind of things there are in general, maybe even if you're in a game that like you can maybe that just for one game that we had this 

Speaker 2  (04:24)
Maybe we can collect all the monsters maybe we meet and once we met them, we can see them in the creatures. 

Speaker 3  (04:35)
Mhm that's an interesting idea, like what I but what I thought just like when you open one of the games that you can like, add points where you were like places or things that like items are picked up or people you met with names and whatever that would be cool as well. 

Speaker 1  (04:55)
Yes, okay, I think I'll stop it here at this point. And we've already talked about quite some things I would like to just quickly ask you. So in general, the impression, did you did you get in the kind of an idea of what it could look like, how well did you deal with the blueness and the roughness of it? 

Speaker 3  (05:20)
I love it. I want it to stay like that forever. 

Speaker 1  (05:24)
I hope not. 

Speaker 4  (05:26)
I feel like it's not very fantasy-welcoming. It's great for like stucture and you can really see what's happening everywhere, but again, it's just like reminds me of like a to-do-list. 

Speaker 4  (05:41)
And it's just like very bold. And just I would prefer like if there would be some kind of design, at least some parts of it 

Speaker 1  (05:50)
I think I'll skip the others, because you've talked enough about those. You're doing great, by the way, it's really valuable what you're saying. Okay, so now I have a task for you 3. Um, so multiple, so first of all, I would like you to open up your character sheet, let's not no, no, not that, on the app. 

Speaker 1  (06:13)
Great, Theresa already did it. Now I would like you to find something in your inventory. Find some equipment. 

Speaker 3  (06:22)
Equipment equipment like, why do you light up 

Speaker 1  (06:30)
It lights up and you click past it. That's like to tell you hey, you can click here. 

Speaker 3  (06:37)
There's equipment all my shield, weapons. 

Speaker 4  (06:42)
Is this how much money we have? 

Speaker 3  (06:45)
Like I think that's like copper points, silver whatever, gold coins, and then we have weapons equipment such as general equipment, weapons shield armor okay, yeah, so 

Speaker 1  (06:59)
Okay, you you made it, you finished the task, very well. So now I would like you, if you were like, imagine you were in a game right now. This is your character, sheet of course, there's no real text on it, but make a skill check. You need to run & jump. 

Speaker 1  (07:13)
Where would you go to make a skill check? 

Speaker 3  (07:16)
Abilities, I guess, yeah, cuz there's skills and we have all these skills and we can just scroll right and then here are the competencies. So we have these in the general as well, like the attributes where they think those are the same, or are they? No those are competencies okay, so to make a skill check, we either need to go to this one or this one. 

Speaker 1  (07:40)
Okay, great. What would you do if you had to, for example, use your dagger to make an attack in a fight? 

Speaker 3  (07:52)
Okay, weapon. 

Speaker 2  (07:54)
I think there, if there was a guide at first when everyone first downloaded it, it would, it would be better, but I'll try to going everywhere I can. 

Speaker 1  (08:12)
So yeah, okay. Um What Will you do if I, if I told you that your character takes damage either to your armor or to your health? 

Speaker 3  (08:25)
I thiink I coul go to general and see if it like help us there. It's not. Oh, no, wait, we have health up there, right, what can we click on you? 

Speaker 1  (08:39)
Oh no, you can't. But that's exactly what I wanted you to do okay, and now I would like to ask if you wanted to edit your character or maybe level it up, what would you do? 

Speaker 3  (08:53)
Maybe get on that, sign down there level up, click on that maybe. 

Speaker 2  (09:00)
Maybe here so something... In this three points? Or maybe I'll try to exit out... 

Speaker 2  (09:15)
And then there would be like normally when I leave, you can (unintelligebile) and then it will ask so do you want to save that? And I'll just click "Yes". 

Speaker 1  (09:31)
Okay, so um okay. If you compare this to the paper version, how well do you think the structure of this works? 

Speaker 3  (09:42)
So I think this insanely well structured. And I think like all in all it's it's really amazing. I just think that the paper has a vibe and that of course you can't put that in an app, so maybe just through colors or something like that, but I think the structure is insanely good. 

Speaker 1  (10:00)
Well, this is all about structure anyway, so yes. 

Speaker 3  (10:02)
A lot better than the paper version! 

Speaker 1  (10:05)
Okay, that's great. 

Speaker 4  (10:06)
So yes, it has great stucture. But like um, I just, I think I got used to like the paper and having to be able to see a lot at once, just be able to find all the information quickly and just know where to look, like, I probably get used to this too and be able to like use it quickly as well. 

Speaker 4  (10:29)
But at first I still need to get used to it, I think 

Speaker 3  (10:32)
I think what would be great, maybe like that for the phone, the phone or maybe like a second version, a bigger version, where you have like, or maybe some other way to open that up that you have been the front page of the sheet like visible, like if you open it like on an iPad or a screen, that's bigger, then you can see, like the typical that you see when you have the paper version yeah. 

Speaker 1  (10:56)
Would you if you were in a game playing? Would you rather use your phone or your tablet to check on your character? 

Speaker 3  (11:03)
Definitely my tablet, okay, it's all I think it's way more like visible, and you have more space to like 

Speaker 2  (11:11)
It's bigger and I can have more space. 

Speaker 4  (11:15)
I feel like I won't get distracted as easily and I just like feel like, okay. I have like my own little table that I can like play on. 

Speaker 1  (11:23)
Okay, that's good. Yeah, I think that's pretty much all of that there. And then the last kind of thing it is, actually I should have let you do that, I would like you to create a character. 

Speaker 3  (11:43)
Oh I think we just need to go like you just did that already. But like in here to the add-sign and then then yeah, okay, right. Oh, there's a text that's amazing. 

Speaker 1  (11:54)
Oh well most of it is just lorem ipsum. I tried to put some text somehwere. 

Speaker 3  (11:58)
yeah, but like in general, how that works, probably, that's cool. Human, Elf, Dwarf, Kagari and then you just click through it 

Speaker 1  (12:13)
Do you wanna select the race? 

Speaker 3  (12:15)
Alright, let's just let's select. Can we give it a name? It's say 

Speaker 1  (12:18)
Not yet, unfortunately 

Speaker 3  (12:21)
Oh, then let's say Kagari, oh and then we have heritage. Okay and select it. Oh, we got something that's cool and we already have a heritage that we go on, we have that, so we go to Role, and we're very happy, and uh, spy, it's the first one. 

Speaker 3  (12:41)
Select. good, okay, and then you can just pull it out. That's, that's great. Why? 

Speaker 1  (12:57)
It's just to show that you can change them. 

Speaker 3  (12:58)
That's okay. 

Speaker 4  (13:02)
Yeah, okay. 

Speaker 3  (13:06)
What's happening? Yeah, okay, it just makes sense. And then we can do that that that's cool. 

Speaker 3  (13:14)
That's cool how many steps I can do 

Speaker 2  (13:17)
It's easy to understand. 

Speaker 3  (13:18)
Oh no, we can't. But okay, we have items and then it's done oh, there's missing like a "finish button", but 

Speaker 4  (13:31)
We have a "save thing". 

Speaker 3  (13:32)
[Voices overlapping] like couldn't? It doesn't work 

Speaker 1  (13:38)
You could try to leave.. That actually is the only button that works. There's one where it doesn't make sense. Yes, I'm sorry that is kind of sad. 

Speaker 1  (13:50)
Okay, so I think that was your really fast in that. Was it confusing? Or did you feel well guided? 

Speaker 4  (14:02)
Well would you expect us to have so like the whole sheet of information next to us while doing this? Or would you just like try to only have the app? 

Speaker 1  (14:11)
Oh, only the app. 

Speaker 4  (14:12)
I probably would find it a bit confusing like, because the text wasn't like always there? I think, like, for example, with like the competence, it's like somewhere, look at that, no okay. 

Speaker 4  (14:29)
There is some text. But I find it's just rather small and you just don't really know what to look at, I think, and if you'd be that guided, for example Maybe like with the heritage, maybe something could light up and there could be like a shorter version of like what a human is, or like, what an Elf is. 

Speaker 4  (14:51)
It's just like guide you through it and just help you kind of focus on something 

Speaker 1  (14:58)
Would you prefer this to be every time? Or maybe the first time you make a character, you get help texts, and then every other time you know what you're doing at. 

Speaker 4  (15:07)
I feel like the first time would be rather necessary and if you need it, it's like for the next time as well, you can maybe just adjust it and just like kind of click on it 

Speaker 3  (15:20)
There was this when you opened one that there was this text and I, I think I know what you mean like I think I think as well it would be great to have like a first guide through when you put it first and then you would just be able to get that text when you opened it again. 

Speaker 1  (15:37)
Do you have any finishing thoughts about... What do you think about the the touch targets in general and the font sizes? Text sizes, do you think Text is big enough? 

Speaker 1  (15:59)
Do you think the the touch... you struggled a bit in the character sheet? I remember you were trying to find, like trying to tap the right thing, in general, did you did it feel natural or Did you struggle with the sizes of the points that you were able to click? 

Speaker 3  (16:15)
Actually, to be honest, I think my main problem was that like i'm pretty far away, so it's a little bit harder, but even like being pretty far away, I think it was pretty visible. So I think it's it's actually a great size, okay. 

Speaker 1  (16:28)
And I wanna quickly just go to one of the texts. That's, for example, quite small. So for example, this text is quite small 

Speaker 4  (16:37)
Yeah, that is rather small. I also like, if you click on it to make it bigger or is this just like the whole thing? And it's just like this size? 

Speaker 1  (16:46)
Maybe what you would like to have is like, maybe a short snippet, and then if you click on here you get like the full big text? 

Speaker 3  (16:51)
Yeah, that'd be great! 

Speaker 1  (16:55)
Okay, good. Is anything you specifically liked or anything you specifically dislike throughout the whole thing, that you wanna mention? 

Speaker 4  (17:06)
I feel like some parts, for example, like library like I think it could be like part of the world and not necessarily be like for every game. Just maybe there's like a bit more structure like I don't understand like, of course, you have a lot of heroes, but like if you have different games, do you have like? 

Speaker 4  (17:32)
Do you have the same heroes for all the games like it? It's just a bit. It's just like not enough structure, I think 

Speaker 1  (17:42)
Yes I agree. Because I haven't. That's not part of it yet. Yes, right, so that concludes this testing. I will stop the recording.
