Speaker 1  (00:00)
I started the recording. Hello, welcome too, probably the last testing. Okay, how are we doing, are you happy? It's finally over. 

Speaker 1  (00:13)
No, you love doing this, okay. Yeah so, again, remember, this is not a test and this stuff is very unpolished and unfinished, so I'm asking you to give me your honest reactions and opinions and tell me what you think. So, we're gonna look at the last part of the app that we haven't seen yet so I'm going to ask you Imagine you are looking for world of Discordia, game content such as an adventure book with a premade adventure. 

Speaker 1  (00:53)
Where would you go? 

Speaker 2  (00:55)
Ah, I think to the resources part. 

Speaker 1  (00:58)
Yes, very good also remember to speak a little louder so that I have a better, uh, time, transcribing you. So you've found the resources. Now you can take a look around and then just um, yeah, navigate to one of the Resources and Tell me What You See. 

Speaker 3  (01:20)
Yeah, so it's just like they're and at the top, they're 2 things like browse I guess it's just the open source stuff from the creators like new releases, the basic rules etcetera and I think the other one's owned and I guess this is maybe something either that you can buy or something that you put a mark on like you want to keep That in memory or something you created yourself. I guess that. 

Speaker 1  (01:50)
You want to add to that? 

Speaker 2  (01:51)
No, it was what she said. Um, yeah, here we can see rules adventures and settings. 

Speaker 3  (02:01)
Ah, yeah that's cool. 

Speaker 2  (02:03)
And uh, that the newest release, so I think it's, it could be kind of the makers from the game, put all the new things they've put, or I think it would be also cool if other people could write a game and upload it here and I can search it and just take the games of random people 

Speaker 1  (02:28)
So imagine you found a resource that seems relevant to you, please navigate to the Description of the Resource. 

Speaker 3  (02:35)
Okay, so let's let's take the first one of new releases, we have the title and then the short description, so I'm just gonna click that, yeah, then we have a full description and tags and oh, we can also download it or put a tag on it. 

Speaker 1  (02:53)
No, so what information about the resource is presented here? 

Speaker 2  (02:59)
Um, so we have the title, we have a short form of the description and we have a long form the description here are texts, so maybe the theme or the I don't know like to group the different things to that and we will have a picture here i think. 

Speaker 1  (03:17)
Yes. 

Speaker 2  (03:19)
Um, so I would think that oh 

Speaker 3  (03:22)
There's all those contents ah so maybe how many year Ah, how many spells, NPC's, location etcetera are already in there? 

Speaker 2  (03:32)
What I would um think there must be somewhere the name of the creator of that, but I didn't found it. I guess it will be somewhere because it would make sense? Um, so here you can, it's, it's like content list 

Speaker 3  (03:52)
Yep. 

Speaker 1  (03:54)
Um, is there anything about this page that you find confusing or unclear? 

Speaker 3  (03:58)
Not really. I think it's very clear. 

Speaker 1  (04:01)
Okay, how would you use the um download or the add to library buttons? What would you expect them to do? Like the little bookmark thing 

Speaker 3  (04:13)
I'd, like with the bookmark, I guess it would just um like add to the library obviously, and then you can go to the library and open it anytime and I think for the download. It would add to the library as well, maybe a different section of the library with downloads, and then you could use it even if you're offline, so you wouldn't like need to have an internet connection. 

Speaker 2  (04:36)
Maybe if something in the resource will be changed or deleted when we download it, we wouldn't see it but if we just put a bookmark on it and the creator will delete it we don't see it anymore. 

Speaker 1  (04:51)
Okay. Okay. So, um, when you go ahead and like click the bookmark, uhm icon there so yeah, so when you look at the first time, you would get a little notification that it's been added to your library and then when you click on it again this is what you would see 

Speaker 3  (05:11)
Okay, so 

Speaker 1  (05:13)
Okay, okay, did you read through it? What it said? No, why not. 

Speaker 3  (05:21)
Because we're a lazy I guess 

Speaker 2  (05:23)
Well, I did read the like keywords that we were asked if we really want to remove it from our library and I just said cancel, so I think I read it, but not so... 

Speaker 1  (05:36)
Okay, um all right, so why don't we just go ahead and download one of the resources? 

Speaker 3  (05:47)
Yay. Boop and download. Oh so it's like, Ah, that makes a lot more sense. 

Speaker 1  (05:53)
All right, so let's imagine that you're going to read it. And please show me how you would and move through the contents of the resource. 

Speaker 3  (06:00)
I'd just click on read book and then we have different chapters with subchapters, then I just like click on one of them and then there's chapter one and those and there's also to standard text that's cool and then headlines, sub-headline and that's that looks nice. Oh you can also add bookmarks and maybe notes of something and search 

Speaker 1  (06:27)
Mhm 

Speaker 3  (06:28)
And down here you can click on the next chapter. 

Speaker 1  (06:31)
All right, do you think it is it easy or difficult to navigate through the resource? 

Speaker 2  (06:37)
Um, I think for the for the first time, it's really easy. I don't know if still that easy if I have a lot of resources downloaded. Um, because then I could get confused, because I don't know where to click on it, but if I'm on the resource to find this part of the of the content, it's easy. 

Speaker 3  (07:02)
I think as well it was fairly easy. 

Speaker 1  (07:04)
Okay, what do you expect when you click on the bookmark icon now? 

Speaker 2  (07:11)
Um, I would expect that this chapter is bookmarked, right? 

Speaker 3  (07:17)
I'd expected that if you then close the book and like the resource and open it again that there would be some kind of marking on like the chapter. 

Speaker 1  (07:28)
Okay, um, how would you go about searching for specific content within the resource? 

Speaker 3  (07:34)
I'd click on that search icon 

Speaker 1  (07:36)
Mhm ok 

Speaker 2  (07:38)
I think doesn't work yet 

Speaker 1  (07:41)
How about finding a specific chapter, uh? 

Speaker 2  (07:45)
I would go to the contents. 

Speaker 3  (07:51)
Hm download it again from here in the chapters, okay? 

Speaker 1  (07:56)
Okay, erm, so you did not see that there is also like a table of contents icon up there. 

Speaker 2  (08:06)
This one, yes, uh well uhm 

Speaker 1  (08:09)
What do what would you have expected there? What did you think that that would be? 

Speaker 2  (08:14)
I didn't really think about that. Like I saw it as you mentioned I realised that it was there but before I didn't thought about it. 

Speaker 1  (08:24)
Right so you can like open it, actually that one works. Okay, um, if you go back to the book, do you think you know how you could change the display settings? 

Speaker 3  (08:46)
Yeah, here's I click on dark mode, cuz it looks like a dark mode thing but it doesn't do anything. 

Speaker 1  (08:52)
What would you expect to find- Oh if you like press three time that opens the like um prototype settings. Where would you expect to find under display settings? 

Speaker 3  (09:02)
So definitely like a light in Dark mode, and maybe a way of changing the colours in general, like maybe of the of the of the written text, maybe like now it's blue, maybe to black or pink 

Speaker 1  (09:18)
Okay. 

Speaker 2  (09:19)
So maybe also the size of the text, because some people might have difficulties. 

Speaker 1  (09:25)
Right for this book or for the app and general 

Speaker 2  (09:29)
Um, I think because it's we're doing the setting in the book, I would think it's just for this book, but if there would be the same icon in another part I would guess it's for the whole app. 

Speaker 1  (09:45)
Okay, good, very well now. Um, uh, we've kind of looked at the resources now. Let's say you want to find info related to specific official game topic for example, the details of a spell, please show me how you would go about finding information of interest. 

Speaker 2  (10:07)
Firstly, I would navigate back to the Resources 

Speaker 3  (10:12)
And then browse. 

Speaker 2  (10:13)
Here's, yeah, of course, not the owned, yeah, and then so I would think it's in the rules part, maybe 

Speaker 1  (10:25)
Okay, those are actually the same, I'm going to um I'm going to stop you right there. Um, okay, so I think this would need probably a bit of a tutorial in the beginning then, because when you add a resource to your library, it will be added to the library and there are specific parts that are always part of it, for example, like the basic rules. 

Speaker 1  (10:51)
Um, if you go to owned the basic rules have a like bookmark icon and that means they're all like they're added to your specific library. So I actually would like you to head over to the library tab in, uh, at the bottom. All right so yeah, so now. 

Speaker 1  (11:18)
Um, let's I'll, I'll repeat the task again. So let's say you wanted to find the details of a spell. Show me how you would go about finding that information. 

Speaker 3  (11:30)
Go on the spell of grimoire, I gues. Then like if I knew the name of the spell, just search for the spell. 

Speaker 1  (11:39)
Okay, umm, can you go ahead and look around and describe to me the organisation of the library. 

Speaker 3  (11:49)
Okay. So it's um, at the head, we have a search for next to it I think like filters, um, at least it looks like it's supposed to be for filters and then we have a lot of icons with um, different things like different titles, like spell grimoir, equipment vault, beastiary of creatures etcetera, and when I scroll down, there's just more of those and those are all different things, but like it has an end. So it's not that many like categories 

Speaker 1  (12:23)
And like when you go into the categories what like, how is it organised? 

Speaker 3  (12:28)
Um, very similar like we have like with the spells now we have the search bar and the filters and then you have the single spells down there. I guess they'd be sorted by I don't know, uh, how far in the game you'd be to collect them or I don't know with the beginning letter or something like  that um, and then we have some kind of icon at the top 

Speaker 3  (12:50)
I don't know what it is for. AH and there you can switch to another um. 

Speaker 1  (13:03)
Category? 

Speaker 3  (13:05)
Yeah Category right. 

Speaker 1  (13:07)
Alright, um, so that was like, actually, my next question was that if you can see how to switch category from like within, a category but you found that. Um, so we wanted to look at the details of a spell. Um, could you go ahead and show me like the details of it? 

Speaker 1  (13:44)
So you've now you've found what you want in the library. Explain to me the content what you see here. 

Speaker 3  (13:54)
So, uh, we have like the spell name at the top. Then there are a few basic informations listed like difficulty, base costs and etcetera. Then there's little describing text as far as I can see um and down there are more things about, I don't know what these are like Elemental, mind, light, dark, hedge, 

Speaker 3  (14:17)
General? and then there's a table 

Speaker 2  (14:20)
Oh I think those are the colours what, uh, like if we search if we search for something about the mind, we have to search for something blue in this, uh, text maybe? So if we just if we were wizards and would know more about the spells and search for an information, it will help us to navigate to this information um judging from the colour, maybe 

Speaker 1  (14:46)
Okay. 

Speaker 3  (14:48)
And down there, they're the basic rules beneath the table. Ah and then maybe this is just um the stages like, um, what level it is like the first thing "TN" and then the standard cost, how much does it cost obviously, And then what effect like how much does it expend when you do this at the next level. 

Speaker 1  (15:17)
Um, could you go ahead and also show me the details information on a deity, on a God? 

Speaker 3  (15:25)
Okay, I'd go back to the whole categories because I already saw that there was tome of gods and click on that and just go to the first one and then you have like a picture and uh, yeah, the the infos on it. So like the basic info: symbol, spheres, and then there's description and then core beliefs, that's good, then organisation, Places of worship, I think it would be great if like there was a way of maybe navigating to that like if we, if you were in a game like if you have a game and then you have like different places that you could mark that this worships this God, then you could click on that and go 

Speaker 3  (16:15)
There and see that like it's that and that god 

Speaker 1  (16:18)
Okay, do you have any additions? You kind of zoned out 

Speaker 2  (16:24)
No I was listening but she was saying everything that I I thought. 

Speaker 3  (16:29)
We're so well connected. 

Speaker 1  (16:32)
Umm, do you find the content and information to be clear and understandable? 

Speaker 3  (16:39)
Yeah, til now yeah. 

Speaker 1  (16:42)
So we'll call these like single entries right [unintelligibe], is there anything you would like to add a change about entry content? 

Speaker 2  (16:52)
Um I don't think so, like because we don't know that much about those gods, we don't know what's really important. Like I know just from the Greek gods that they are all like a family, maybe this could be like, kind of a family tree, but I don't know if it's in this game the same with them gods all related to each other 

Speaker 1  (17:20)
But you would be, let's say, satisfied, if um, with the information that's they're like a picture and some general information in text form? 

Speaker 3  (17:29)
Yes, I think it's good that the general information is like, in short text that you can skip through it, then they're a longer texts for description and where they're worshipped and all of that. 

Speaker 1  (17:39)
Okay. Umm, so lastly, we, I would like to explore your profile, so please find the area where you can view your profile information. 

Speaker 3  (17:54)
I'll guess that we need to go out and because we already checked that there's like a little person sign, and then we have our own for profile and we're not logged in. 

Speaker 1  (18:04)
So please go ahead and create a new account with your school account. 

Speaker 3  (18:10)
Okay, then I'll just go on account I guess and then register new account and then sign up with school email. Let's do that. 

Speaker 2  (18:21)
Select your school so [Name of school] 

Speaker 3  (18:24)
Wow Yeah! 

Speaker 2  (18:26)
The best school is the first we can find. 

Speaker 3  (18:30)
Example[email], there's missing an s 

Speaker 2  (18:34)
No it's just teachers. 

Speaker 3  (18:36)
Yeah, it's teachers mail. 

Speaker 2  (18:37)
Are we teachers now? 

Speaker 3  (18:39)
And we register. [unintelligible] Account created, that's nice. Then we can like have a profile picture and a name and info about ourselves. 

Speaker 1  (18:50)
Very nice. Um, was it easy to figure out which way of signing up you needed to select 

Speaker 3  (18:56)
Yeah, it was. It was pretty, I think it was pretty straightforward like just 2 options as far as I saw like with the title and then in a description, what do you do then. 

Speaker 1  (19:08)
So now that you're logged in well, how would you change your name? 

Speaker 3  (19:15)
I'd just click on it up here like name and then click on it? 

Speaker 2  (19:19)
I would Click on account that that's a thing that are always 

Speaker 3  (19:23)
I think I took on that with the with the general. Or account or account. 

Speaker 2  (19:29)
Yeah here we can change the picture the name the email and also the password. That's cool. We can delete it, oh, we don't want to delete it. 

Speaker 1  (19:38)
Um, you already clicked on the general to like change your name. What would you expect to find in the general setting? 

Speaker 2  (19:44)
I think maybe the language and I would think it's more the app settings, and the profile settings. 

Speaker 1  (19:53)
So also maybe like display settings, like you talked about earlier for the whole app? 

Speaker 3  (19:57)
Yes, I would expect that there as well. 

Speaker 1  (20:01)
Right? And how would you look out of the application, like how would you log out of your account? 

Speaker 2  (20:07)
Yeah we can go on account then the 

Speaker 3  (20:10)
Log out, right. 

Speaker 1  (20:12)
Very nice. So um, now to finish up. I have some general questions for the end of the session. Um, so overall, how easy or difficult do you find to use the application now taking into account kind of like everything we've done? 

Speaker 3  (20:31)
I find it pretty easy like I think of course, with most things, you'd have to like check and think for a second, but most things are pretty straightforward and I think they're pretty self explaining so I really like that because you just need a basic way of, you know, having brain cells too understand what's going on there. 

Speaker 1  (20:51)
Okay. 

Speaker 2  (20:52)
Like I also think, um, it reminds me a little too unix or linux systems because it's it's not that full and there is a lot of information a lot of things we can do, but it's not that um, much things at once. It's all grouped in different parts and I think that's what it makes so, um it's easy to understand and if I have understood it once then I can find it again very fast. 

Speaker 1  (21:19)
Is there anything about the layout or design that you find particularly confusing? 

Speaker 3  (21:26)
not really. 

Speaker 1  (21:27)
I could imagine, for example, that it's all you know, blue would be kind of hard for me, but 

Speaker 3  (21:33)
No I really like that blue color so I'm not complaining there and it kind of expect, like the app to have some kind of own home design that before you change it to your own custom, that'd it be, had that it would have some kind of you know, general thingy, maybe that or maybe just rusty old parchment whatever Yeah. 

Speaker 1  (22:01)
If you don't have any additions, you don't have to say anything. Um, so, based on your experiences today and the last few times do you have any suggestions for improving this application 

Speaker 2  (22:17)
Um well, of course, it's not- there are some um things not working, they're not clickable yet, but I think that's kind of obvious. Well I really like it and I would know nothing we need to change. 

Speaker 1  (22:37)
At this point of time, at least 

Speaker 3  (22:39)
Yeah, same yeah. 

Speaker 1  (22:42)
And uh, uh. 

Speaker 3  (22:46)
Is it is it possible like is it planned that it'll be possible that and when we look at these resources? Yeah, when we look at the resources that we first of all we'll see who created them and then we can maybe go on their profile and see what else they've created and what do they do and maybe send them a text 

Speaker 1  (23:05)
So for now, it's thought to be kind of limited for data protection reasons. Um, so all of the content that can be like shared is either from official sources, or part of the games that you make with your friends that you have to like know in order to share stuff with. Um, but definitely for the future. I have that in mind that it's great that you ask for this. 

Speaker 1  (23:36)
Um, that you can like, upload your own things and share them and everything that's definitely planned. Uh also, what I kind of like didn't I uh talk about is like the game templates because you asked about this. I implemented that where if you create your own game. 

Speaker 1  (23:55)
Now you can choose from a template so that it would fill this game with all the content from the resource that you have, and then you could play this like adventure with your with your friends and that's how you would um use official content. Um and everything that's like user-generated is, you know, more complicated, um, but that would definitely be an idea for the future. 

Speaker 3  (24:21)
Yes, great. Then I think that's it. I think it's already so amazing. It looks, it looks great 

Speaker 1  (24:28)
That's very sweet. Actually, my last question would have been if you have any questions that was already one, are any more questions you would like to ask? 

Speaker 2  (24:37)
Um, so is the plan to put it on the App Store? 

Speaker 1  (24:42)
It's planned to have it as a progressive wep app so you would download it through the browser and it would run as if it was an app that you downloaded from store um, but it would be sort of like a website that has offline functions. 

Speaker 3  (24:59)
That's cool. That's amazing yeah. I don't have any more question as well. 

Speaker 1  (25:02)
All right, okay, thank you. Then I'll stop the recording here.
