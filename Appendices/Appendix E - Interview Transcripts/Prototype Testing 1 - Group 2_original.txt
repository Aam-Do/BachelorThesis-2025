Speaker 1  (00:00)
Okay, recording is in progress and so I will have you do the same thing as the other ones did. Um, if you want to come a little closer together and both of you can use the app. I would like you to just first just start experimenting with it tell me your thoughts as you're as you do get trying to talk me through what you're thinking. And for now, we're just going to experiment with the entire overlay that and I might tell you to go back at some point, because I now we'll look at further things later. 

Speaker 2  (00:36)
So here, a lot of heroes! I think I can click on it. I think these are the same as on the character sheet, and 

Speaker 1  (00:54)
So that's really good for now. We'll look at this one later, so please go back. 

Speaker 2  (00:58)
Okay, you so, um, here I think we can search the heroes. 

Speaker 1  (01:14)
Yeah, you can't yet, yeah, some functionality, it's not. That's not, it's not yeah, actually most functionality is not in there yet. 

Speaker 2  (01:22)
And here we can make a new hero I guess? Here we have a profile. Data security, how do you.. try it.. 

Speaker 1  (01:51)
This one doesn't work. 

Speaker 2  (02:01)
They're all Lorem. 

Speaker 3  (02:13)
Something to do [unintelligable] character? There's a part that isn't in English. 

Speaker 2  (02:32)
Yes, it's lorem ipsum. It's like a computer language if you want to fill out space. I knew it. 

Speaker 1  (02:37)
In German we call it Blindtexts. 

Speaker 2  (02:43)
I tried to learn it, but I can't remember that far. 

Speaker 1  (02:47)
Oh no, it's huge, I se an online generator to get it. It's just to portray that there might be text here that I don't have yet yeah. 

Speaker 3  (02:56)
Yeah, that it's good and then you can go farther to the 

Speaker 1  (03:01)
Let's do that later and let's try to get back to the main levels. Okay, trying to get back to the main 

Speaker 2  (03:08)
Place where it started. 

Speaker 1  (03:11)
Actually, I have to do this for you, because... all right. So there's more on the like, if you say like the level of hierarchy on this level, there's something more that you haven't looked at if you want to check them out, real quick. Not on this page, but uh.. this would be one step into the hierarchy. 

Speaker 2  (03:37)
So that one. It went here, so I think these are other creatures like the enemies or other. I don't know living things in a roleplay Game. Um, we've been here. So I can't really think of what this will be when it's yeah, but maybe that's like some information about spells or weapons? 

Speaker 1  (04:16)
Okay, the resources. I really, I really like that, both you and Mika tried to swipe there, it's it's really good, okay, that's um, that's that for this. So now I would like to ask what's your general impression of this as a prototype? 

Speaker 1  (04:32)
I know it's very blue and it's obviously not done yet, but um, do you think you kind of have an idea of what it could be like in the end, of what the structure is? 

Speaker 3  (04:47)
I think it's quite, sometimes on the structure that think is very well I think you could understand it quite fast, yeah. 

Speaker 2  (05:00)
Ok I think for these symbols and items in this footer part, it's very fast to navigate ourselves so that's very important in the roleplay games when we want to know something that we don't need that much time to search it and we can just click on these icons. 

Speaker 1  (05:20)
Um, you say that the structure makes sense to you? Do feel like you kind of, you already said a bit what you expected there to happen, So that's something. um and we'll just skip that one okay. 

Speaker 1  (05:34)
Next, I would like you to um, take a look at your character sheet on the app like on the phone. Yes. 

Speaker 2  (05:43)
So characters are here like, on a new one or? 

Speaker 1  (05:49)
An existing one. 

Speaker 2  (05:50)
Okay i figured some 

Speaker 1  (05:55)
Good and then, um, I would like you to tell me something that's in your inventory 

Speaker 2  (06:08)
Equipment, so we have some weapons and other equipments. 

Speaker 1  (06:24)
Okay. Good that you did that. So, now if I asked you to do a skill check like a Run and Jump check? You can grab it as well if you want, you can take it onto your lap, towards you if you want 

Speaker 2  (06:43)
It's maybe on the general, the skills 

Speaker 2  (07:09)
we have some actions here like, but I think it's more like the opportunities we have. 

Speaker 1  (07:18)
I'm looking for a skill check. 

Speaker 3  (07:21)
Maybe maybe, this and like... 

Speaker 2  (07:31)
Oh, here, skills... 

Speaker 1  (07:34)
Very good, um, and if I asked you to make a dagger attack, where would you go? 

Speaker 2  (07:40)
So we had the these in the equipments? You know I think the dagger so here and the weapons are in it equipments? I don't know. 

Speaker 3  (07:54)
Um, yes, there were 2, maybe we have to go on that. 

Speaker 1  (08:00)
Okay, what do you think is the difference between combat and make an equipment? in this structure? There's no wrong answer, I'm trying to understand what you're thinking. 

Speaker 2  (08:12)
I think in the equipment, those are general information like if we would want to sell it in the marketplace, we would go there. But now, when we're fighting and we want to know, I don't know, how much damage we will make or if we should throw it away and take another weapon, I'll try it with that, we would look here because it's more special for our situation, not just a general thing? 

Speaker 1  (08:36)
Okay so, you would go into the combat tab, when you're in the fight and you want to kind of like, find out what you're doing right now? Would you do you agree with that? Yeah, okay. 

Speaker 1  (08:45)
Um, so if I told you that you take damage, what you do. Naw, sometimes that doesn't work. I'm sorry that's hard. 

Speaker 2  (09:00)
Oh, it's just when I go, um, maybe the notes part...? 

Speaker 1  (09:11)
Where would you look at your armor or health in general? 

Speaker 2  (09:16)
My health? Yeah, I think I would I think that health is in the general part some more here... well it's defense so I would write it down how many defence points I have here. 

Speaker 1  (09:30)
Okay, um, what about if you scroll all the way back to the top? 

Speaker 2  (09:41)
Oh here, yes. 

Speaker 1  (09:43)
Yeah, don't, no worries. Did you notice that this was there the entire time? 

Speaker 2  (09:48)
Well I noticed that there was something but... okay it totally makes sense, but I didn't very think about what it would mean. 

Speaker 1  (10:00)
It's completely fine. 

Speaker 3  (10:03)
Yeah, I just didn't look and then looked at that and thought about. Maybe it is the button? 

Speaker 1  (10:11)
Do you think if these were like icons like a shield and the helmet and the heart, for example, you would have, maybe, maybe do you think that could have helped you? 

Speaker 2  (10:22)
Yes, because if I see this app for the first time, I will first look at the icons, then at the texts. 

Speaker 3  (10:30)
Yeah, I think the same 

Speaker 1  (10:34)
Okay, and now, if you wanted to level your character or edit, where would you go? 

Speaker 2  (10:39)
I think on this setting point? It looks like settings. Yeah, here's level up. 

Speaker 1  (10:48)
It doesn't work but yes, and if you want to edit the character or delete it? What would you do? 

Speaker 2  (10:52)
I think for deleting.. here? 

Speaker 3  (10:58)
Delete hero [unintelligable] 

Speaker 1  (11:03)
You wouldn't have to press it again because you just closed the thing that's fine, but you did the right thing. Okay, and did you notice that there's a 3 point menu also on this page? 

Speaker 2  (11:13)
Oh, those um, yes, I look at it after we changed here. 

Speaker 1  (11:22)
And what would you think to, what do you expect? If you click on there? 

Speaker 2  (11:28)
I think maybe also um deleting, or other information about if we get lost. Yeah ok here's deleting in editing and also export as pdf. 

Speaker 1  (11:43)
Okay, very good thank you. So now that you've looked at this character's sheet. Um, compared to the paper version, um, how do you like this mobile version? 

Speaker 2  (11:58)
Umm, well for me, it seems logically, um, better to have it on the phone. I don't know, I won't be in this situation that I see someone in the street and want to play a roleplay game, yes, I know that it won't happen. But so I know that I have with me and if I don't know I have to wait in the train I can just edit it. 

Speaker 2  (12:21)
And I think it's a good thing. 

Speaker 1  (12:23)
If you're playing if you're playing here with us, would you rather use your phone or your sheet, like the paper sheet, or a tablet? Like this app on a tablet, 

Speaker 3  (12:35)
I think the phone, but to be honest, I would use the sheet to make the character and would then do the information in the app cause on the paper. I think it's all more. Yeah, that you have it in one piece. 

Speaker 1  (12:56)
So you would make the character and then you would export it to the PDF and then have the PDF as a printed thing? 

Speaker 3  (13:04)
No I think I would use it on the phone. 

Speaker 1  (13:10)
So did you how did you feel about searching for information? Did you experience frustration? Or did you find all of information where you expected it? 

Speaker 2  (13:19)
I think most were where we expected it, like the health points were somewhere else, but it took very short time to find it, and I think normally if I see a new app I would also click on every icon to just see what it means. 

Speaker 1  (13:34)
Okay, um, okay, let's uh, quickly do the last thing I want you to try. I would like you to try to create a new character. 

Speaker 2  (13:47)
New hero.. you can give it a name? 

Speaker 1  (13:52)
No, unfortunately not. 

Speaker 2  (13:55)
There's a description how to do it. So what do we want to take? 

Speaker 3  (14:06)
Let's take a dwarf. We haven't had that yet. 

Speaker 2  (14:11)
So select... it's cool that we can read it here. 

Speaker 1  (14:20)
And that doesn't work again, just have to click again. Oh, it's fine. You can, you can continue, just like that just goes back to the normal page, you can continue as if you hadn't done that 

Speaker 2  (14:33)
So let's just take the last one of this. I want... This table is cool, I think. 

Speaker 1  (14:57)
You would be able to input your things like that, it doesn't work yet. Very well. An example as well. You know many buttons don't work yet, but I'm very glad to see you try because that means that you, they look clickable. Okay, umm, so how was that how how well did you manage this? Was it was it confusing? Or do you feel guided? 

Speaker 3  (15:48)
I find it super as well with the description of short descriptions of different possibilites and the things, I think that it's very well because when you haven't it in mind, you can decide it. And it was very, yes structured, I think, in the end it would be good to. Don't let us go further if we hadn't chosen everything so you can forget anything [unintelligent]. 

Speaker 2  (16:31)
Well, I think it's um, it's totally logical. It's the better than a lot of apps, I tried 

Speaker 2  (16:41)
In the last year, we always have to get new [characters] in the school. So I really like it um and I think also for the orientation, there are a lot of different things we can do on this app, but it's not chaotic, so It's easy to remember where we found the information before 

Speaker 1  (17:01)
Okay, very good. All right, so the last thing I would like to ask you is if you felt like the sizes of the texts and the touch targets were big enough. Yes, mm, I know, yeah, you were able to read everything you want to read and you're able to click without misclicking. 

Speaker 1  (17:19)
Great, and then is there anything specifically liked or it disliked? Any detail you would like me to know before we finish up and we go home. 

Speaker 2  (17:33)
Well, as mentioned, I really like those icons because, for me, it's the most logical thing. And I like that the description is always given when we click on it so it's not. It's not annoying. 

Speaker 2  (17:49)
Sometimes we always have to read everything like with the security of apple, we always have to "I understand I understand". Here if we have read it before, and we know it, we just put it away, but if we want to know it, we can read it. 

Speaker 1  (18:06)
Great, thank you. That's it, I'll start the recording and
