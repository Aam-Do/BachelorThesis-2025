Recording in progress. Hey, okay. So today I will be asking you about game directing, so in game mastering in Dungeon's and Dragons, that's the the Dungeon Master. 

Speaker 1  (00:16)
And I would like to start with general questions again and the first one would be: Have you ever directed a game, I think I know the answer to this one, but I'm asking it anyways. Have you ever directed a game in any system? 

Speaker 2  (00:33)
No I haven't. Me neither. 

Speaker 1  (00:34)
You neither okay, why not? 

Speaker 3  (00:39)
I think we both don't have enough experience to do so and we didn't have the time so I think you can say more to that? 

Speaker 2  (00:50)
I, like, uhm last year, we had a friend who was directing for us in DnD. It was a real fun party. But um, uh, due to those most of the people in this group graduating, we had to end the sessions like the game in general and we didn't pick it up again and then we for like, with a few of our friends in our age decided we wanted to do 

Speaker 2  (01:15)
our own game and got a few people together who want to do that and over the summer holidays, I prepared kind of a world direction everything, but then Ms Mukasa, I told us about your work and we were like, okay, yeah, let's do that. 

Speaker 1  (01:30)
So okay, so all these questions are probably more towards you, but Feli, feel free to answer as well. So would you like to run a game? You've already said you started working on something, how how do you feel about that? 

Speaker 3  (01:49)
I think it's quite interesting, but it's also 

Speaker 3  (01:55)
more work than playing in the session, I think? And uhm yeah, it's, it's worse when we make mistakes when directing the game so I think I 

Speaker 3  (02:09)
Yeah, I wouldn't really want to do it, but I quite think it's interesting. 

Speaker 1  (02:16)
So if you uh, run your own game, would you rather have like a premade, so like an adventure, an official one, or would you rather write your own story, both of you? 

Speaker 3  (02:31)
So I would like to have a prepared story because I can't still change things if I want something different but so I can be sure that there are no real mistakes I do when realizing the story. 

Speaker 2  (02:48)
I think it would really like it if there was a premade game. So over the holidays, I did try to find one that felt like Hey, this would be kind of be a good vibe for the group and maybe good for a story and everything and there were many good games I found online, but I didn't really quite 

Speaker 2  (03:06)
feel like those were the ones I wanted to play so just. I thought, okay, I'm gonna do my own, and I think that's cooler. 

Speaker 1  (03:12)
Okay. So maybe you already started doing that, but also if you haven't, how would you approach keeping track of your game? Uhm like taking notes, keeping track of the story in the npc's and locations 

Speaker 3  (03:34)
[German] 

Speaker 1  (03:37)
[German] 

Speaker 3  (03:37)
[German] 

Speaker 1  (03:39)
[German] So I'm just going to ask the question again. So how would you approach keeping track of your game, so the story, the npcs, the characters and the locations that you're going to run through and taking notes throughout, throughout the game. 

Speaker 2  (04:03)
So I was, I had like a GoodNotes thingy like online and then my plan was to just have page for every session and have like one book for the sessions and 1 book for the npcs and characters and everything with the character sheets, I had that prepared and then in the other book it had like. Session 0 and then 1, 2, 3, for every session, a page already, and then like a few notes in black pen, what I wanted to approach in this session, then I planned um and keeping a different color for making notes, 

Speaker 2  (04:36)
so what's actually happening in the game like important things? 

Speaker 1  (04:39)
Okay. 

Speaker 3  (04:43)
So I'm not sure, I think I would do the npcs on paper because so it's easier to have them next to each other and easier to look at all of them. Because at GoodNotes I feel like it's sometimes a little hard to switch between the sites and then finding it again, like I always had this problem in class when I search for the information of something and Then Want To get back to my exercises. 

Speaker 1  (05:10)
So you also answered my next question about the tool, so GoodNote, it's just a normal, note taking tool, right? 

Speaker 2  (05:19)
But yeah, I think it's iOS Coded. 

Speaker 3  (05:22)
I don't know, we get GoodNotes from the school or here. 

Speaker 2  (05:27)
I think it's good. 

Speaker 3  (05:27)
Because normally it's a little expensive for the premium 

Speaker 2  (05:33)
Hey, it's a, it's â‚¬11 for 

Speaker 3  (05:38)
Yeah, I think One Note is the iOS thing. 

Speaker 2  (05:43)
[unintelligable] 

Speaker 1  (05:47)
That's fine, and lastly, do you feel like it's too hard to direct a game? 

Speaker 3  (05:56)
I would say for me, it was too hard because I don't have a lot of experience and I think even when I had more experience, it's just still very... it's easy to make mistakes. I don't know, but yeah, we always have to I remember what the people did and still get the story in progress, so I think for me, it would be very hard. 

Speaker 2  (06:27)
So I haven't directed the game yet. Obviously, but it's it's sounded a lot like a lot of fun and I would really like to try that out because I think it's yeah, I think with a cool group. It's it's yeah, I think it sounds cool. 

Speaker 1  (06:41)
Okay, great. Um, I'm going to pause the recording for this part.
