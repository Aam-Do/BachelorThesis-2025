Speaker 1  (00:00)
Recording in progress. So now my tablet picks up everything you say. It's okay, you don't have to be scared. So first of all as I said this is, everything we do now, it's not a test. Uh, there's no wrong answers you just tell me whatever you can and um, because we're doing it like this. 

Speaker 1  (00:21)
It's going to be open format. Try not to talk over each other so that I can do Transcript later easier, but apart from that, um, we'll try to do it in English. If there's the word you don't know, just switch to German, I'll figure it out. So first of all, I would really like to know how old each one of you are. 

Speaker 1  (00:37)
So I mean, if you could just go around and say your age. 

Speaker 2  (00:42)
Um, do we have to say our names? 

Speaker 1  (00:44)
No, because it's an anonymous 

Speaker 2  (00:48)
I'm 15. 

Speaker 3  (00:49)
19 

Speaker 4  (00:51)
19 

Speaker 2  (00:54)
Like our real age. 

Speaker 1  (00:56)
No no, your real your real ages actually, so. I was like. Yeah, 19, that's crazy. So, 15 again, 15, 14. 

Speaker 4  (01:08)
19, in september 20 okay. 

Speaker 5  (01:12)
16. 16. 

Speaker 1  (01:13)
Okay. Um, what's your previous experience with tabletop RPGs? In a short, like answer? And if any of you don't want to answer, you don't have to. Like if you yeah, but I need like at least one person to answer 

Speaker 2  (01:29)
Personally, I didn't have a lot of experience. I did develop a character before this one and like usually just like remember, had best of improvisation and it's just like role play in general, from like the games. 

Speaker 1  (01:44)
Which system of you use for the character before? 

Speaker 2  (01:47)
For DnD. 

Speaker 5  (01:51)
Um I have been part of a tabletop in DnD 5th edition before, but for the I've already had a lot of contact within like online and the summer I did prepare a session which I did not end up using. 

Speaker 6  (02:08)
I was part in the tabletop AG last year but we didn't really finish our session because we didn't had the time, but I also wrote some characters before. 

Speaker 1  (02:18)
Characters, multiple, yes, how many 

Speaker 6  (02:22)
Oh I think like 3 or 4. 

Speaker 1  (02:26)
Did you play with all of them or? 

Speaker 6  (02:28)
Oh, it's just like the one but you I had fun doing those characters. 

Speaker 1  (02:32)
Okay, you had fun making the character. Yes, even though you didn't play them. 

Speaker 4  (02:38)
Never before. The only thing I do, which is maybe a little bit related too this. 

Speaker 1  (02:47)
Could you speak up a little cause. You're very far away and it's very quiet. 

Speaker 4  (02:51)
Well I've never done before the only thing which might have a little bit of relation to this. Is writing some short stories. 

Speaker 3  (03:04)
Yeah, I haven't um those plays before this. I've done theatre and I wrote stories too. 

Speaker 1  (03:14)
Okay. So regarding the character creation that, um, you've done for this specific thing. So I gave you the character sheets and the rules and everything. Um, how long approximately did you take to make your character, how long did you sit there, if you had to estimate, if you had to guess? 

Speaker 1  (03:38)
It's also okay if you say long or not very long 

Speaker 5  (03:42)
And I think it was very short, like with my experience with DnD, like I did very, made a lot of characters that would took way longer. I think in general, for this character was about an hour a maximum. 

Speaker 6  (03:55)
Like 2 or 3 hours. 

Speaker 2  (03:58)
I think like I definitely spend less time for this character than for dnd, but um, so like a few hours, okay. 

Speaker 3  (04:06)
Yeah, I worked here on it, and I think it took like 2 hours on the 

Speaker 1  (04:11)
Nah, no I was like 1 hour maybe 45 minutes actually. That clock is wrong. It's ok 

Speaker 4  (04:21)
I looked for the name for a lot of time? So I think maybe an hour before and plus today, maybe 

Speaker 1  (04:31)
All in all rather short. Um, were you're satisfied with the amount of time you spend or did it feel too short or too long? 

Speaker 2  (04:41)
Um, I feel because like I kind of used some time until I got to the point of making my character for the last session, I just forgot a lot of stuff. So I had to really read everything over and over again to remember everything and so I can quite get everything. So I'm not quite satisfied with myself just basically, but I think I still can kind of like finish with my character, but I'm still quite fun with what I have. 

Speaker 1  (05:09)
Okay. Yeah, we're not completely done yet, that was well yeah. 

Speaker 5  (05:13)
I think I really enjoyed this time because it was, it was, sure it was compact and I could have spend a lot more time with it making more detail and it could I think it could have done it shorter like just making a very a basic character and I think was actually pretty pretty good. 

Speaker 1  (05:29)
All right, um, so where the rules for character creation easy to understand? Just from your feeling? What I gave you 

Speaker 6  (05:43)
I think some of them were like the attributes, I think there were easy and to decide on the heritage um, I had a feeling that the leftest side of this sheet was a little more difficult, but besides that, I think wasn't that difficult. 

Speaker 2  (06:07)
I've just found difficult that um like in the session, when I have you here and I can ask you any questions, it's easy of course, but like when I was on my own, I just had to reread a lot of stuff and felt like I couldn't find information I was looking for sometimes, and that's what made it like rather difficult. 

Speaker 5  (06:31)
Oh yeah, I feel like it was pretty fine, like the document you gave us or what was... it didn't really have any kind of um, you know, it was very long and very, uh, not very easy to see you know. Didn't have a good structure maybe? Yeah it didn't have much structure, so I think that was maybe the hardest part of it. To find like specific details. But I think in general was pretty good to understand. 

Speaker 4  (06:56)
Generally, I can understand almost everything in that with a dictionary and I think when it is more structured then it might be better. 

Speaker 1  (07:13)
Okay umm, so you mentioned the left side of that thing, which was calculating stats, how did you feel about the calculation part of it or the maths part in general? 

Speaker 2  (07:25)
It's great. 

Speaker 4  (07:27)
It's great. I didn't have a problem with it at all. 

Speaker 1  (07:29)
Okay, like you, you don't have to have a problem with it. 

Speaker 2  (07:34)
I just think like I'm not sure if I put all the points and the correct places if it's really like the way I would find it the best because like I don't have experience with it. But it's fine 

Speaker 6  (07:48)
I think the calculation itself wasn't that difficult but to really understand what do I need in what point? Because in some cases, there were different names so there were named on the sheet different than in the document. But so the calculation it was just plus and minus, wasn't difficult. 

Speaker 1  (08:10)
So you mentioned that you used a dictionary. Did anyone else have language problems or struggles with words? 

Speaker 5  (08:18)
I think the only thing I struggle was like the paths exactly cause there were a few names of the paths that I didn't really know, so I had to look them up to know the exact like I knew generally and what kind of direction that was doing, but I didn't know this specific thing. I think the rest was actually pretty good to understand. 

Speaker 6  (08:37)
I think there are a lot of things that I also wouldn't know in German, so the weapons and the Shields, so I just don't know them so I had to look that up and look at pictures, but it's not really the language so 

Speaker 1  (08:52)
Would you all think maybe if you had more pictures? Would that have helped you understand better? 

Speaker 2  (08:57)
Especially for weapons I think yeah. 

Speaker 3  (09:01)
I think it would irritate me because it would be I think when there if there were picture, think it were quite much so I think it would have um thrown me out. 

Speaker 2  (09:14)
Or I think like, for example, for the attributes. Um, maybe descriptions would help too. 

Speaker 1  (09:23)
There is a description in the rules that we read, but I didn't give you that, I think, again, so that's on my part. And then lastly, for the character creation, does the structure of information in the character creation rules makes sense to you? The order of things. 

Speaker 5  (09:42)
It does, yeah, it's generally like it's I think the pretty like the basic physics and everything seems to be very, basically like in, like in the real word and the general concept of how things work seems pretty logical. 

Speaker 1  (09:58)
Um, I meant more of the, uhm the order of steps that you took in the character creation. 

Speaker 2  (10:05)
oh yeah. 

Speaker 5  (10:06)
Yeah, that was. I think that was pretty logical as well, because like in the document you have like these layers and then first you went like what's at the top of the sheet, and then what's next? I think that was pretty good, okay. 

Speaker 2  (10:18)
I only feel like some parts were like left out, somehow I, I'm not sure if it's true or if I just like didn't really read everything but, but overall, the structure was great. 

Speaker 1  (10:33)
If there's any additions then you can add them, but you don't have to 

Speaker 4  (10:37)
For me the introduction for different rules and paths can be some better so...  write, written for talents because, at first when I read the talent for the, for the Explorer, I didn't think it's a talent, it's, I thought it was just an introduction for this role. 

Speaker 1  (11:07)
Okay, thank you. So that was all for the character creation. Now I would like to ask a bit about the character sheet that we had in front of us, um, so, did filling in the character sheet feel easy to you? In the sense of that you knew where to put what? 

Speaker 5  (11:23)
Yeah, like I think the most complicated thing was just that in the document the names or something was different than on the sheet. But I think in general, it was really really, I think it was rather easy to fill out. 

Speaker 3  (11:36)
I need a moment allways to realize what belongs where, but then it was quite easy to look at it and decide it. 

Speaker 4  (11:47)
By competencies, I wonder where I can write the reasons or the reasons were just needed to be spoken. 

Speaker 6  (11:58)
Oh well, I'm sorry, I think it did make sense and it's very good structured. There was one point where sometimes I got confused because I read to fast. I think, um, it's presence and reason, because it looks very similar and if you're reading very fast, I sometimes took the numbers wrong place but yeah, but It's maybe just also because of me 

Speaker 1  (12:29)
So maybe also, if it was maybe a little bigger or easier visible, which one it is? 

Speaker 6  (12:35)
Yeah, maybe just because those 2 words are very similar 

Speaker 4  (12:39)
Or maybe with different, so, symbols? 

Speaker 1  (12:45)
Maybe maybe with little icons, something like that. Okay, um, you already said that with the order of the character creation that kind of made sense with the order on the sheet as well, would you all agree? That the order of information on the sheet makes sense? It's it's okay if you don't agree. 

Speaker 6  (13:07)
So there was one point was searching it in the document, but I didn't found it now and like the description of the path and then how, what this path is really doing from the numbers on the sheet and then how you calculate them that were like 3 different parts than in the document so I had to skip some pages and then come back there to fill out the sheet. That made me miss some points inbetween of that yeah, yeah, but maybe if the the description like the text description and the numbered description of the path would be more closely together, it would be easier. 

Speaker 1  (13:57)
I have a question for like how well the sheet assisted you in play, but we didn't actually get to stuff from that, so I'll skip those um, and then I'll stop the recording for now.
